**Week 2 - The Sequential model API**
</br>
</br>
Duering this second week, the course delves around learning on how to use the high-level Keras API for quickly building, training, evaluating and predicting from deep learning models. 
</br> 
It is explained that there are multiple ways to build and apply deep learning models in TensorFlow, from high-level, quick and easy-to-use APIs, to low-level operations, though above is way the selected. 
</br> 
Last, the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) of handwritten images is introduced and examples of practice are provided.
