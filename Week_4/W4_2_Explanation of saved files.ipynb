You looked at the saved files using the `! ls` command. The saved files were the following:\n","\n","```\n","-rw-r--r--  1 aph416  staff    87B  2 Nov 17:04 checkpoint\n","-rw-r--r--  1 aph416  staff   2.0K  2 Nov 17:04 checkpoint.index\n","-rw-r--r--  1 aph416  staff   174K  2 Nov 17:04 checkpoint.data-00000-of-00001\n","```\n","\n","So, what are each of these files?\n","\n","#### `checkpoint`\n","This file is by far the smallest, at only 87 bytes. It's actually so small that we can just look at it directly. It's a human readable file with the following text:\n","```\n","model_checkpoint_path: \"checkpoint\"\n","all_model_checkpoint_paths: \"checkpoint\"\n","```\n","This is metadata that indicates where the actual model data is stored.\n","\n","#### `checkpoint.index`\n","This file tells TensorFlow which weights are stored where. When running models on distributed systems, there may be different *shards*, meaning the full model may have to be recomposed from multiple sources. In the last notebook, you created a single model on a single machine, so there is only one *shard* and all weights are stored in the same place.\n","\n","#### `checkpoint.data-00000-of-00001`\n","This file contains the actual weights from the model. It is by far the largest of the 3 files. Recall that the model you trained had around 14000 parameters, meaning this file is roughly 12 bytes per saved weight.\n","</br>\n","\n","### Further reading and resources\n","* https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/save_and_load#what_are_these_files"],"metadata":{"id":"TAJclmxz5w8F"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[""],"metadata":{"id":"SKGqYs3a6Rom"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
