**Week 4 -  Saving and loading models**
</br>
Along this fourth week, it is explained how to save and load TensorFlow models according to certain criteria depending on deep learning model development needs. 
</br>
Also, it is introduced how to use callbacks to save models, manual saving and loading, and options that are available when saving models, including saving weights only. 
</br>
For that purpose, [EuroSat dataset](https://github.com/phelber/eurosat) is used.
