**Week 3 - Validation, regularisation and callbacks**
</br>
</br>
During this week, it is introduced model validation and regularisation techniques to help prevent overfitting and improve generalisation. 
</br>
In addition, usage of callbacks to monitor performance and perform actions according to specified criteria is presented.
